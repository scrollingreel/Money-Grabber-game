"Building MoneyGrabber: A Pygame Reaction Game with Amazon Q CLI"
🚀 Introduction
Recently, I built a reflex-based game called MoneyGrabber using Pygame and supercharged it with Amazon Q CLI, Amazon's AI-powered coding assistant. The project combined Python, game development, AI logic, and creativity — all made smoother and faster with Q CLI.
Special thanks to Shafraz Rahim for organizing this amazing initiative and motivating developers like me to build and share! 🙌

🎮 Game Concept
MoneyGrabber is a fast-paced game where you and an AI bot race to tap on a randomly appearing "money" object. Whoever taps first — wins. Sounds simple, but when you turn up the difficulty, the bot becomes quicker and smarter.
🔥 Key Features:
Easy, Medium, Hard difficulty levels
Smart AI bot with decreasing reaction time
Score system for both player and bot
Randomly spawning money visuals
Cloud animation and light visuals

🛠 Tech Stack
💻 Python + Pygame – core development
🤖 Amazon Q CLI – assisted coding & logic generation
🐧 Ubuntu – development environment
📦 Git – version control

🤖 Amazon Q CLI Experience
Amazon Q CLI made my development super efficient. I used it to:
Scaffold the base of the game loop and UI logic
Generate structured code snippets like generate_clouds() and AI bot logic
Debug and optimize frame rate issues
Refactor long classes and functions cleanly
It literally felt like having an expert Python coder by my side at all times.
